## Installation on Windows

For the binary version, extract all the contents of `pidgin-hide-chat-on-join`
in the ZIP file either to the installation directory of Pidgin (typically
`C:\Program Files\Pidgin`) or to your .purple user directory (typically
`%APPDATA%\Roaming\.purple`).

See below for how to compile the source code version into a binary ZIP file.

## Installation on Linux

To install the plugin on Linux you need to extract a release tarball and compile
it from source:

    sudo apt-get install pidgin-dev intltool
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

**Note:** By default the plugin will be installed to `/usr/local`.  If you
installed Pidgin through your package manager, it is most likely installed into
`/usr` (i.e. `which pidgin` returns `/usr/bin/pidgin`). Use
`./configure --prefix=/usr` in this case.

**Note:** When you use the repository directly or one of those auto-generated
"Source code" archives, you need to run `./autogen.sh` before running
`./configure`.


## Building on Windows

In order to build the plugin for Windows an already-compiled source tree of
Pidgin is required. Please see the [Pidgin for Windows Build Instructions](https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/BuildingWinPidgin)
for details.

After that you need to create a file named `local.mak` that points to the Pidgin
source tree, e.g.:

    PIDGIN_TREE_TOP=$(PLUGIN_TOP)/../../pidgin-2.10.11

Now you can build the plugin:

    make -f Makefile.mingw
